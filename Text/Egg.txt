'Just a short video on how you can add an easter egg to your Visual Basic 2008 Program by typing a code, keyword, or hitting any series of buttons. 
'In this example, I used the combination 1234, just for an example.


Code (Just paste it right in to any of your programs, changing Form1 to whatever your form is called.): 

Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load 
	KeyPreview = True
End Sub

Private Sub Form1_KeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs) Handles Me.KeyDown 
'Note: D1, D2, D3, and D4 are just the numbers above Q, W, E, and R. Change the Keys.D1 to whatever you want. 

If e.KeyCode = Keys.D1 Then 
	Timer1.Enabled = True 
End If 

If e.KeyCode = Keys.D2 And Timer1.Enabled = True Then 
	Timer2.Enabled = True 
End If 

If e.KeyCode = Keys.D3 And Timer1.Enabled = True And Timer2.Enabled = True Then 
	Timer3.Enabled = True 
End If 

If e.KeyCode = Keys.D4 And Timer1.Enabled = True And Timer2.Enabled = True And Timer3.Enabled = True Then 
	'Put what you want to be an easter egg here. 
	Timer1.Enabled = False Timer2.Enabled = False Timer3.Enabled = False 
End If 

End Sub
